# ASCII Mirror

This is my completed ASCII Mirror project from the JetBrains Hyperskill Java For Beginners learning track.

The premise is simple: Input a file path, read the data in the file, and then format the data so that it is mirrored on the screen. While this was a very basic project and easy to complete, I learned a lot about reading and working with data in files.

**Test file paths you can use to see the program in action:**

./test/example1.txt<br/>
./test/example2.txt<br/>
./test/example3.txt<br/>
./test/example4.txt<br/>
./test/example5.txt

Otherwise, use any file path you'd like from your own system and see how it works!
